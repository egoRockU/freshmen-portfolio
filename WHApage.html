                <h3>Instagram Clone</h3>
                <p>With the help of the webinar, I learned the basics of CSS or Cascading Style Sheet. We were given a task to make a copy of instagram's user interface. It was the first time I played around with CSS and I choose to use it in this portfolio.</p>

                <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
                <p>Here I learned that frameworks exist and its convenience in building a website. I honestly didn't bother to learn this specific framework because I wanted to get better at CSS first. It contains minor edit which is just changing the background and changing its color scheme from the original project that the presenter provided.</p>

                <h3>Tailwind</h3>
                <p>It is another framework same as bootstrap. We were given a task to edit the project that the presenter provides.  I just did some very minor changes to it.</p>

                <h3>Vue.js</h3>
                <p>Another framework but it requires basic knowledge in javascript. I haven't done any projects using javascript so using this framework confuses me. I somehow manage to do the coding challenges the presenter wanted us to do by trial and error. </p>
